# SQL Project: Bookstore Database Analysis

## 📄 Description
This project focuses on querying a relational database of a fictional bookstore using SQL. It involves performing multi-table joins, filtering, aggregation, and applying logic to extract insights from sales, customers, and inventory data.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL dialect)
- DBMS/SQL Interface (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin, Jupyter SQL extension)

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Explore relationships between authors, books, and publishers
- Write queries to answer business questions (e.g., top-selling genres, inventory gaps)
- Practice JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, and NULL handling

## 📌 Key Results
- Identified underperforming genres and authors
- Highlighted inventory patterns and stock gaps
- Practiced complex multi-table joins and aggregate logic

## 📁 How to Use
Run `SQL Project.ipynb` if using a notebook-based SQL interface, or paste the queries directly into your SQL environment. Each cell contains a query block with commentary.
