# Supervised Learning Project

## 📄 Description
A machine learning classification project focused on comparing supervised models like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests on a labeled dataset.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Train and compare classification models
- Analyze performance using precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score
- Tune hyperparameters for decision tree and random forest models

## 📌 Key Results
- Random Forest achieved the best F1-score
- Confusion matrix and classification report used for evaluation
- Demonstrated model tuning and selection process

## 📁 How to Use
Open `Supervised Learning Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook. Follow each section from data loading to model evaluation for a full ML pipeline.
