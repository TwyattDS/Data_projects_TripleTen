# Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a fictional telecom provider, **Interconnect**, and builds predictive models to identify which customers are at risk of leaving. The main goal is to help the business retain more customers by using actionable insights and accurate churn predictions.

## Objectives
- Explore patterns in customer demographics, contracts, and internet service.
- Preprocess and clean large multi-table datasets.
- Build classification models to predict churn.
- Evaluate performance using AUC-ROC and Accuracy.

## Key Tools & Libraries
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- LightGBM, RandomForest

## Highlights
- Feature engineering from contract types and services
- Balanced dataset for training
- Final model: LightGBM with AUC-ROC score of **0.88+**

## How to Run
