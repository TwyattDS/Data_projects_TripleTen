# Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

## Overview
This educational notebook explains how core linear algebra concepts power machine learning algorithms. Includes interactive coding examples.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate vector operations, matrix multiplication, and eigendecomposition.
- Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to image compression.
- Show how PCA reduces dimensionality using covariance matrix.

## Key Tools & Libraries
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (PCA)

## Highlights
- Hands-on image compression using SVD.
- Visual exploration of vector spaces.
- Connects math theory to real ML workflows.

## How to Run
1. Open `Linear Alg Project.ipynb`.
2. Follow markdown instructions and run code cells.
