# Computer Vision Project: Sign Language Classification

## Overview
Built an image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures from image data.

## Objectives
- Preprocess image data and normalize pixel values.
- Build and train a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Key Tools & Libraries
- TensorFlow / Keras
- numpy, matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image handling)

## Highlights
- Achieved over **95% accuracy** on test set.
- Included real-time prediction from webcam (optional).
- Model suitable for assistive tech applications.

## How to Run
1. Open the `Computer Vision Project.ipynb`.
2. Ensure TensorFlow and required libraries are installed.
3. Run training and prediction cells.
